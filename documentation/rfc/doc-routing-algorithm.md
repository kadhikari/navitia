### RAPTOR and the specificities

The routing algorithm is built around RAPTOR, a routing algorithm developped at Microsoft and published in 2012. The paper can be found [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/raptor_alenex.pdf).

Basically, you give RAPTOR a set of journey patterns it can use, a set of stop points (for transfers) and date-times to reach the stop points. It gives you, for each stop points and each number of transfers, the earliest arrival date-time.

Our implementation is very close to the original RAPTOR algorithm. There are 2 added functionalities:
 - stay in: they are opportunistic, i.e. using the 'stay in' is not guaranteed to be optimal. Journey patterns don't take 'stay in' into account.
 - ITL (Interdiction de transport local, [local travel restriction](https://github.com/google/transit/issues/117)): as there is only one zone per stop time, the implementation is quite straightforward: on the first pickup, set the current zone to the zone of the stop point. If the zone changes, no more drop off is forbidden because the good pick up can be chosen afterwards.

 Journey patterns are generated automatically. They must have the same succession of stop times (except date-times) and must not overtake.

### First pass

In this section, you can find raptor results examples. Our implementation doesn't remember the vehicle journeys used, they are chosen by the raptor solution reader, explained later.

The algorithm's input is a set of journey patterns and stop points, along with a starting date-time plus durations to access the reachable stop points. These last 2 inputs are used to compute the first TR0 line.

The PTx (for Public transport level X) lines correspond to the earliest arrival to a stop point using x vehicles (stay in don't increment the level). The TRx (for transfer level X) corresponds to the earliest arrival at a stop point after x vehicles plus the connections.

So in this first RAPTOR pass, navitia only minimizes arrival time and the number of connections.

### The first pass on example 1

Starting from A at 7:45:

|level| A  | B  | C  | D  | E  | F  |  G      |
|-----|----|----|----|----|----|----|---------|
|TR0  |7:45|    |    |    |    |    |         |
|PT1  |    |8:30 ![](https://placehold.it/15/010101/ffffff?text=2+) |8:33 ![](https://placehold.it/15/010101/ffffff?text=2+) |8:36 ![](https://placehold.it/15/010101/ffffff?text=2+) |8:50 ![](https://placehold.it/15/ff9b19/000000?text=1+) |    |         |
|TR1  |    |8:32|8:35|8:38|8:52|    |         |
|PT2  |    |    |    |    |    |9:00 ![](https://placehold.it/15/000af0/ffffff?text=4+)|**10:00** ![](https://placehold.it/15/00aa00/000000?text=5+) |
|TR2  |    |    |    |    |    |9:03|10:02    |
|PT3  |    |    |    |    |    |    |         |

Starting from A at 7:55:

|level| A  | B  | C  | D  | E  | F  |  G      |
|-----|----|----|----|----|----|----|---------|
|TR0  |7:55|    |    |    |    |    |         |
|PT1  |    |8:30 ![](https://placehold.it/15/010101/ffffff?text=2+) |8:33 ![](https://placehold.it/15/010101/ffffff?text=2+) |8:36 ![](https://placehold.it/15/010101/ffffff?text=2+) |9:10 ![](https://placehold.it/15/ff9b19/000000?text=1+) |    |         |
|TR1  |    |8:32|8:35|8:38|9:12|    |         |
|PT2  |    |    |    |    |9:00 ![](https://placehold.it/15/ff10010/000000?text=3+) |9:00 ![](https://placehold.it/15/000af0/ffffff?text=4+) |**10:20** ![](https://placehold.it/15/00aa00/000000?text=5+) |
|TR2  |    |    |    |    |9:02|9:03|10:22    |
|PT3  |    |    |    |    |    |    |**10:00** ![](https://placehold.it/15/00aa00/000000?text=5+) |
|TR3  |    |    |    |    |    |    |10:02    |
|PT4  |    |    |    |    |    |    |         |

The different PTx on the destination stop points gives the earliest arrival to our destinations for each number of connection. In this case, if the target is G, starting at 7:45 from A gives G at 10:00 using 1 connection, but starting at 7:55 gives 10:20 using 1 connection ![](https://placehold.it/15/ff9b19/000000?text=1+)![](https://placehold.it/15/00aa00/000000?text=5+) and 10:00 using 2 connections ![](https://placehold.it/15/010101/ffffff?text=2+)![](https://placehold.it/15/ff10010/000000?text=3+)![](https://placehold.it/15/00aa00/000000?text=5+) (or ![](https://placehold.it/15/010101/ffffff?text=2+)![](https://placehold.it/15/000af0/ffffff?text=4+)![](https://placehold.it/15/00aa00/000000?text=5+)).

Note that the TR0 can have several entries, and, in practice, there is a few hundred of them (all the accessible stop points by feet).

### Second pass

As our main objective is earliest arrival time, and then, at equal earliest arrival time, the latest departure time, We need another optimization as RAPTOR doesn't minimize this. Therefore, a second pass is done on the journey: for each candidate arrivals, rerun RAPTOR in other way around, maximizing departure times.

The number of second passes can be quite high. To limit this, navitia computes a bound of the journeys ending to our current second pass initialisation, and check if this bound is dominated by the previously found journeys (found by the previous second passes). Thanks to this optimization, a lot of useless second passes can be avoided. To be safe, the number of second passes realized is globally bound (see the `max_extra_second_pass` parameter of the algorithm).

To minimize the work done by a second pass, the datetime calculated at the first pass are reused to compute bounds on each stop point. Thanks to these bounds, the second pass avoids to compute pathes that will never be accessible by the stop points of origin, greatly reducing the search space.

### The second pass on example 1

From the first pass from A at 7:45, there is only one candidate second pass: ending at G at 10:00:

|level| A      | B  | C  | D  | E  | F  |  G  |
|-----|--------|----|----|----|----|----|-----|
|TR0  |        |    |    |    |    |    |10:00|
|PT1  |        |    |    |    |9:05 ![](https://placehold.it/15/00aa00/000000?text=5+)|9:07 ![](https://placehold.it/15/00aa00/000000?text=5+)|     |
|TR1  |        |    |    |    |9:03|9:04|     |
|PT2  |**7:50** ![](https://placehold.it/15/ff9b19/000000?text=1+)|8:41 ![](https://placehold.it/15/ff10010/000000?text=3+)|8:40 ![](https://placehold.it/15/000af0/ffffff?text=4+)|8:35 ![](https://placehold.it/15/ff10010/000000?text=3+)|    |    |     |
|TR2  |7:48    |8:39|8:38|8:33|    |    |     |
|PT3  |**8:00** ![](https://placehold.it/15/010101/ffffff?text=2+)|    |    |    |    |    |     |
|TR3  |7:58    |    |    |    |    |    |     |
|PT4  |        |    |    |    |    |    |     |

The second pass finds 2 candidates: from A at 7:50 with 1 connection, and from A at 8:00 with 2 connections.

### Solution reader

[TODO] The goal

[TODO] The objectives

[TODO] The search space

[TODO] The branching scheme

The parameter `walking_transfer_penalty` has been added to give an additional walking cost on additional connection.
Hence, increasing that parameter (default is `120` seconds) would favor walking a bit more to avoid a connection. It does not impact anything else and is not reported in the final journey.

### Advantages and drawbacks

Advantages:
* Diversity
* Performance
* Flexibility

Drawbacks:
* Not exact walking objective:  
  The first pass does not optimize walking. This can lead to situations where the first pass removes options that would be valid in term of walking optimization.  
  The second pass is also bound by the `max_extra_second_pass` parameter (default to `0`) which can lead to sub-optimal journeys for the walking part.
* Difficulty to add objectives
* RAPTOR variants are quite complex and not really combinable

#### Troubleshooting

**Walking issue impacting the _start_ of the journey**  
By default, second passes only take walking into consideration at the arrival.
It is possible to improve that by increasing the `_max_extra_second_pass` parameter (passing it to `10` is an acceptable value).

**Journey with trade-off using unexpected stop_points in terms of walking**  
This can be related to the first pass removing options that would be valid for the walking minimization.
It is possible to check:
* if another journey arrives at the desired stop-point before (or at the same time with less connections) the desired journey
* if forbidding the other journeys (be creative!) helps obtaining the desired journey

In that case, this is a limitation of the current algorithm :-(

## Some ideas for improvement

### Guillaume P. (@texitoi):
If I had to rewrite it, I'd base the algorithm on Connection Scan Algorithm. RAPTOR and CSA are still the simplest, more flexible and more effective algorithms. CSA is simpler, RAPTOR is better when the journey patterns contain a lot of vehicle journeys. Other algorithms try to limit the search space by using the "locality" of the data (in the geographical sense, using contractions or partitionning), but they are much more complex, less flexible and need complex prepocessing.

As direct objectives, I'd use:
- minimize arrival time
- minimize number of transfer
- minimize walking duration
- maximize departure time

All of that should allow to do the first, second and reader pass in just one pass. A stopping criterion can be something like the horizon constraint (arrival no more than x*best+y), doing some kind of journey schedule at the same time.
