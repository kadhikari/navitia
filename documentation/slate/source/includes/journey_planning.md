The multi-modal itinerary feature allows you to compute the best routes from point A to point B
using all available means of travel, including: bus, train, subway, bike, public bike, walking, car, etc.
This function returns a roadmap with specific instructions for a route based on available information,
such as: time of departure and arrival, journey time, possible modes of transport, and walking distance.
