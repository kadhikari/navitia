<a name="realtime"></a> Real time integration in Navita
===============================================

Several endpoints can integrate real time information in their responses. In the response received, a disruption will be present and additional information will be provided if the parameter `data_freshness` is set to `realtime`. If the parameter `data_freshness` is set to `base_schedule`, the disruption is also present in the response for the user information, but it won't be taken into account in the results of the query.

<aside class="warning">
Real time isn't available on every coverage for Navitia. For real time to be available for a client, it needs to provide real time info about its network to Navitia.
</aside>

The effect of a disruption can be one of the following:
<ul>
	<li>[SIGNIFICANT_DELAYS](#SIGNIFICANT_DELAYS)</li>
	<li>[REDUCED_SERVICE](#REDUCED_SERVICE)</li>
	<li>[MODIFIED_SERVICE](#MODIFIED_SERVICE)</li>
</ul>

For each one of these effects, here's how the Navitia responses will be affected over the different endpoints.

<aside class="notice">
A disruption is present in the response of the endpoints described if the request is made during its application period.

```
The effect of the disruption is `SIGNIFICANT_DELAYS`. It means that the train will arrive late at one or more stations in its journey.

In the disruption, the delay can be found in the list of "impacted_stops" with the departure/arrival status set to "delayed".

The status of the journey is `SIGNIFICANT_DELAYS`.

In a public transport section of the response:

* "base_arrival_date_time"/"base_departure_date_time" represent the scheduled arrival/departure time without taking into account the delay
* whereas "arrival_date_time"/"departure_date_time" are the actual arrival/departure time, after the delay is applied

The delay can also be observed for every stop point of the journey with the same parameters in "stop_date_times".  
If the parameter "data_freshness" is set to "base_schedule", then "base_arrival_date_time"/"base_departure_date_time" = "arrival_date_time"/"departure_date_time".

A list of the disruptions impacting the journey is also present at the root level of the response.  
A link to the concerned disruption can be found in the section "display_informations".

    }
    "stop_point": ⊕{11 items},
}
```

In the "stop_date_time" section of the response, the parameter "stop_date_time" is "realtime" and the fields "arrival_date_time"/"departure_date_time" take the delay into account, whereas "base_arrival_date_time"/"base_departure_date_time" show the base-schedule departure/arrival datetime.

A list of the disruptions impacting the departures is also present at the root level of the response.  
A link to the concerned disruption can be found in the section "display_informations".

                    "rel": "disruptions",
                    "templated": false

    "links": ⊕[4 items],
    "route": ⊕{8 items},
    "stop_point": ⊕{11 items},
}
```

In the list of "date_times" available in the response, the parameter "data_freshness" is "realtime" and the field "date_time" takes the delay into account, whereas "base_date_time" shows the base-schedule departure datetime.

A list of the disruptions impacting the stop schedules is also present at the root level of the response.  
A link to the concerned disruption can be found in the in the "date_times" object itself.

## <a name="REDUCED_SERVICE"></a>Reduced service

![image](reduced_service.png)

``` shell
# Extract of an impacted stop from /disruptions
{
    "arrival_status": "deleted",
    "cause": "",
    "departure_status": "deleted",
    "stop_point": ⊕{7 items},
    "stop_time_effect": "deleted",
}
```
The effect of the disruption is `REDUCED_SERVICE`. It means that the train won't be serving one or more stations in its journey.

In the disruption, the deleted stations can be found in the list of "impacted_stops" with the departure/arrival status set to "deleted".  
See the [disruption](#disruption) objects section for its full content and description.

### Journeys

If the stop deleted is the origin/destination of a section of the journey, Navitia will compute a different itinerary to the requested station.  
If not (deleting intermediate stop), the journey won't be affected.  
Either way, a link to this disruption can be found in the section "display_informations" like for other disruptions.

### Departures & Stop Schedules

The departure time of the train with the reduced service simply won't be displayed in the list of departures/stop_schedules if "data_freshness" is set to "realtime".
If data_freshness" is "base_schedule", then the depature time is displayed and a link to the disruption is present at the root level of the response.
In that case, a link to this disruption can be found in the section "display_informations" for departures, in the "date_times" object itself for stop_schedules.

## <a name="MODIFIED_SERVICE"></a>Modified service

![image](modified_service.png)

``` shell
# Extract of an impacted stop from /disruptions

    "amended_arrival_time": "185500",

    "arrival_status": "added"
    "cause": "Ajout d'une desserte",
    "departure_status": "added",
    "stop_point": ⊕{7 items},
    "stop_time_effect": "added",
},
```
The effect of the disruption is `MODIFIED_SERVICE`. It means that there is one or several stop points added into the trip. This can be at any position in the trip (origin and destination included).

In the disruption, new stop points can be found in the list of "impacted_stops" with the departure/arrival status set to "added".  
See the [disruption](#disruption) objects section for its full content and description.

```

The status of the journey is `MODIFIED_SERVICE`. In a public transport section of the response, "arrival_date_time"/"departure_date_time" are the arrival/departure times of an added stop point. New stop points are only used when the "data_freshness" parameter is set to "realtime".

A list of the disruptions impacting the journey is also present at the root level of the response.  
A link to the concerned disruption can be found in the section "display_informations".
