If you want to play with Navitia at a hardcore gamer level, you may want to build some advanced requests: here is [how to](https://github.com/CanalTP/navitia/blob/dev/documentation/rfc/ptref_grammar.md)

You can use these APIs (click on them for details):

-   **[Coverage](#coverage)** : List of the region covered by navitia
-   **[Public transportation objects](#pt-ref)** : List of the public transport
    objects of a region
-   **[Places](#places)** and **[PT_objects](#pt-objects)** : Search for data using autocomplete input.
